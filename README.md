This editor toolbox is (or will be) a collection of tools to make my life as Unity3d developer easier. I hope it can help others game developers too ;)

--------

## Unity version
- Tested on **Unity 5.3.6**

## Tools

### Missing scripts resolver
You changed the name of your MonoBehaviour script outside of Unity3d editor or decided to put them to an external dll and now your prefabs are showing the message below:

>"Missing (Mono Script). The associate script can not be loaded. Please fix any compile errors and assign a valid script."?

The tool "Missing scripts resolver" was created to try to solve this problem. It searchs for prefabs with "missing scripts" problem and fix them.
